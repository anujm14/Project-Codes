This is done and the summary of the model has to be generated to check the summary.\n\n```{r}\n# Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set\nclassifier = glm(formula = diagnosis ~ .,family = \"binomial\",data = training_set)\nsummary(classifier)\n```\n\nThe next step is to get the optimal cutoff point for the ROC curve instead of the 0.5 threshold.\n\n```{r}\n# Predicting the Test set results\nprob_pred = predict(classifier, type = 'response', newdata = test_set)\n\n# Getting the cutoff for the predictions\nlibrary(InformationValue)\noptcutoff <- optimalCutoff(test_set$diagnosis,prob_pred)\noptcutoff\n\ny_pred = ifelse(prob_pred > optcutoff, 1, 0)\n```\n\nThis the next step\n",
